"""jev-loop as an MCP server: Jev decides, the harness (Claude Code / Codex / Hermes) does the work.

The server owns the parts that must not depend on the executor's judgement:
Jev's decisions (route / done / recovery), running the checks, the hard stops
and the decision tape. The client harness (driven by the jev-loop skill)
writes the code and runs the review.

Protocol per turn:
  loop_decide        -> next = "execute" | "review" | "stop"
  (review)           -> loop_record_review -> next = "execute" | "stop"
  (execute role)     -> loop_record_turn   -> checks run, then loop_decide again

Needs TYPESAFE_API_KEY in the environment.
Run:   python jev_mcp.py            (stdio MCP server)
